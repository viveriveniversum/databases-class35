1. What columns violate 1NF?
- All the data should be atomic: food_code and food_description.
- All values in a column must be of the same kind or type: member_address.
- Different types on the same attribute: dinner_date.

2. What entities do you recognize that could be extracted?
- dinner_id&venue_code,venue_code&venue_description and food_code&food_description could be extracted.

3. Name all the tables and columns that would make a 3NF compliant solution.
- Members ---> member_id(Primary Key), member_name, member_address
